When implementing machine learning models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. A smaller dataset with high-quality, well-labeled, and relevant data will typically yield better model performance than a larger dataset filled with noisy or irrelevant information. Invest time in data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering to enhance the effectiveness of your models.
