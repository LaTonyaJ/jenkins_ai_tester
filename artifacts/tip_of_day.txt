Tip of the Day: Always preprocess your data with care by normalizing or standardizing it, as this can significantly improve your model’s performance. Different algorithms have varying sensitivity to the scale of data, so ensuring that your features are on a similar scale can lead to faster convergence and better accuracy. Remember to apply the same preprocessing steps to both your training and test datasets to avoid data leakage.
