When designing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. A smaller, well-curated dataset can yield better results than a larger, noisy one. Implement robust data preprocessing techniques, such as normalization and outlier removal, to ensure that your model learns effectively and generalizes well to unseen data.
