When developing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and representative datasets significantly enhance model performance and robustness, while noisy or biased data can lead to misleading results. Regularly audit and preprocess your data to ensure it meets the standards necessary for effective training.
