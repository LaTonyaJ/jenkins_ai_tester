When designing machine learning models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and relevant data can significantly enhance model performance, whereas large volumes of noisy data can lead to overfitting and poor generalization. Implement robust preprocessing steps and validate your data sources to ensure that your training sets accurately represent the problem you are trying to solve.
