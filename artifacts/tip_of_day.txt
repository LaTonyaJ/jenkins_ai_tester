When designing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and diverse datasets lead to better model performance and generalization. Invest time in preprocessing your data to remove noise, handle missing values, and ensure balanced representation of different classes, as this will significantly enhance your model's robustness and accuracy.
