When designing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-annotated datasets lead to better model performance and generalization. Implement robust data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to enhance your training data, ensuring that your model learns from diverse and representative examples. This foundation is crucial for achieving reliable and accurate AI solutions.
