When developing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Invest time in cleaning and preprocessing your dataset to remove noise and ensure relevance, as high-quality data leads to better model performance and more accurate predictions. Regularly evaluate and update your dataset to reflect changes in the environment or domain to keep your model relevant.
