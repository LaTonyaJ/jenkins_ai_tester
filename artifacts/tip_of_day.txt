Always prioritize data quality over quantity. A smaller dataset with accurate, well-labeled, and diverse samples will often yield better model performance than a large dataset filled with noisy or irrelevant data. Implement robust data preprocessing steps and continuously evaluate and refine your dataset to ensure it meets the needs of your model.
