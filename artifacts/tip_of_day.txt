In AI engineering, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and diverse datasets significantly enhance model performance and generalization. Invest time in preprocessing and augmenting your data to ensure it accurately represents the problem domain, as this foundational step can often lead to better outcomes than simply scaling up your dataset size.
