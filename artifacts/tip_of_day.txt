Always prioritize data quality over quantity when training AI models. High-quality, well-labeled datasets lead to better model performance and generalization. Implement rigorous data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance your dataset, ensuring it accurately represents the problem space and reduces biases that could lead to suboptimal outcomes.
