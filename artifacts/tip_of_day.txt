When developing AI models, prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-annotated datasets lead to better model performance than large, noisy datasets. Implement robust data preprocessing, including normalization, outlier removal, and feature selection, to enhance your modelâ€™s training process and ensure more reliable predictions.
