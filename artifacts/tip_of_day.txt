Tip of the Day: Always prioritize data quality over quantity. A smaller dataset that is well-labeled and representative of the problem domain will yield better model performance than a large dataset filled with noise or inaccuracies. Invest time in data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure your AI models learn from the best possible inputs.
