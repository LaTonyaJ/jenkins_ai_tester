Ensure proper data preprocessing before training your AI models. This includes handling missing values, normalizing or standardizing features, and encoding categorical variables. Clean and well-prepared data significantly enhances model performance and can lead to more accurate predictions. Prioritize this step to save time and resources in later stages of your project.
