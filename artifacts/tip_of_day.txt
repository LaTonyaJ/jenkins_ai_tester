Tip of the Day: Always prioritize data quality over quantity. A well-curated dataset with accurate labels and diverse examples can significantly enhance your model's performance, while a large but noisy dataset may lead to misleading results. Invest time in data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure your AI models are built on a solid foundation.
