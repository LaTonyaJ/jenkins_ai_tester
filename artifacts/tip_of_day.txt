When developing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. A well-curated dataset with diverse, representative samples can significantly enhance model performance and generalization. Regularly clean and preprocess your data to remove noise and biases, ensuring that the input reflects real-world scenarios accurately. This foundational step can lead to more reliable and effective AI solutions.
