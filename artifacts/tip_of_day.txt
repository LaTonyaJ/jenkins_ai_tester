Always prioritize data quality over quantity; clean, well-annotated datasets lead to better model performance than large, noisy datasets. Implement robust data preprocessing pipelines to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies before training your models. This foundational step can significantly enhance your AI system's accuracy and reliability.
