When designing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and relevant datasets lead to better model performance than large, noisy, or unstructured datasets. Invest time in preprocessing your data, as this foundational step can significantly impact the accuracy and reliability of your AI solutions.
