When designing AI models, prioritize data quality over quantity. Ensure your training data is clean, diverse, and representative of the problem space. High-quality data can significantly improve model performance and generalization, reducing the need for excessive amounts of data and helping to avoid overfitting. Regularly evaluate and update your dataset to maintain its relevance and accuracy.
