When designing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and representative datasets lead to better model performance than large volumes of noisy or biased data. Invest time in data preprocessing and augmentation techniques to ensure your model learns effectively from diverse and accurate examples.
