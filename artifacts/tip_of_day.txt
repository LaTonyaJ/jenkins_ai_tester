When building AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. High-quality, well-labeled, and diverse datasets lead to better model performance and generalization. Implement rigorous data preprocessing and validation steps to ensure your model learns from the best possible examples. Remember, a model is only as good as the data it trains on!
