When building AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Ensure that your training data is clean, well-labeled, and representative of the problem domain. This not only improves model performance but also reduces the risk of overfitting and biases, leading to more reliable and generalizable outcomes. Regularly assess and update your dataset as needed to keep your model relevant.
