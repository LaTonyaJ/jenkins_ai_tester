When building AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and diverse datasets lead to better model performance than large amounts of noisy or irrelevant data. Invest time in preprocessing and validating your data to ensure that your model learns meaningful patterns and generalizes well to unseen data.
