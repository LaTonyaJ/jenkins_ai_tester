When developing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. A smaller dataset with high-quality, well-labeled examples can lead to better model performance than a larger dataset filled with noisy or irrelevant data. Regularly clean and preprocess your data to ensure it is representative of the problem you are solving, and always validate your dataset to avoid biases that could skew your results.
