When designing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. High-quality, well-labeled, and diverse datasets lead to better model performance and generalization. Invest time in data preprocessing, cleaning, and augmentation, as this foundational step can significantly reduce the need for extensive model tuning later on.
