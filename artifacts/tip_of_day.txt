When developing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Ensure that your training dataset is clean, diverse, and representative of the problem domain to improve model performance and generalization. Implement robust data preprocessing techniques and regularly validate your dataset to minimize biases and enhance the reliability of your AI solutions.
