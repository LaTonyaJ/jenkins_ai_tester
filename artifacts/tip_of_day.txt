Incorporate version control for your AI models and datasets using tools like Git and DVC (Data Version Control). This practice not only helps you track changes and manage different iterations of your models and data, but also facilitates collaboration within teams, ensuring that everyone is working with the most up-to-date resources and can easily replicate results.
