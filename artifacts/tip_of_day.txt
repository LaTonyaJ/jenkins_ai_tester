When building AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and representative datasets significantly enhance the performance and reliability of your models. Implement rigorous data validation and preprocessing steps to ensure that the input data is consistent and relevant, which can lead to better generalization and reduced bias in your AI applications.
