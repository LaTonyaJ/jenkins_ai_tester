Tip of the Day: When training machine learning models, always start with a well-defined problem and clearly defined metrics for success. This ensures that your model's performance can be accurately assessed and aligned with business objectives. Regularly revisit and adjust your metrics as your understanding of the problem deepens or as the project evolves.
