When training machine learning models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-annotated, and representative datasets will lead to better model performance than larger datasets that are noisy or unbalanced. Invest time in preprocessing, addressing missing values, and ensuring diverse representations to enhance your model's robustness and accuracy.
