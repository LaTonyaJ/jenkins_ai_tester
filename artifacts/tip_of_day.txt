When developing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and representative datasets significantly enhance model performance and generalization. Regularly audit your data for biases and inconsistencies, as these can lead to skewed results and undermine the model's effectiveness in real-world applications.
