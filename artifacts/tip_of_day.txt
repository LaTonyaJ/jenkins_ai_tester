When training machine learning models, always start with a well-defined problem statement and ensure your dataset is clean and representative of the task. Data preprocessing, including handling missing values, normalizing features, and removing outliers, can significantly impact model performance. Additionally, consider using cross-validation techniques to assess the model's generalization ability and avoid overfitting.
