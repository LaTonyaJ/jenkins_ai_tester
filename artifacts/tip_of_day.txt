When designing AI models, prioritize data quality over quantity. A smaller dataset with high-quality, accurately labeled data can significantly outperform a larger dataset filled with noise and errors. Invest time in data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure that your models learn from the best possible examples, leading to more reliable and effective outcomes.
