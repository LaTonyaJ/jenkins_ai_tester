Always prioritize data quality over quantity. A smaller dataset with high-quality, well-labeled, and relevant data will often yield better model performance than a larger dataset filled with noise or inaccuracies. Spend time cleaning and preprocessing your data to ensure it's representative of the problem you're solving, as this foundational step can significantly impact your AI model's effectiveness.
