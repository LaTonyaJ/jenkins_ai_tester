When designing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. A smaller dataset with high-quality, well-labeled examples can lead to better model performance than a larger dataset filled with noisy or irrelevant data. Invest time in data cleaning, preprocessing, and ensuring that your training data is representative of the problem you are trying to solve. This will improve your model's accuracy and generalization capabilities.
