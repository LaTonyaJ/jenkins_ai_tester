When developing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Ensure your training data is clean, well-labeled, and representative of the problem domain. High-quality data leads to more accurate and reliable models, reducing the need for extensive tuning later on. Regularly audit and refine your dataset to maintain its integrity throughout the project lifecycle.
