Always prioritize data quality over quantity. A well-curated, diverse, and representative dataset can significantly enhance model performance and robustness, reducing the risk of bias and improving generalization. Invest time in data cleaning, preprocessing, and augmentation to ensure your model learns from the best possible input.
