When building AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, well-labeled, and diverse datasets lead to better model performance than simply accumulating large amounts of noisy or irrelevant data. Regularly assess and preprocess your data to ensure it is representative and free from biases, which will ultimately enhance your model's reliability and generalizability.
