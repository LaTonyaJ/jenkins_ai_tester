When developing AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. High-quality, well-labeled datasets lead to better model performance and generalization. Invest time in cleaning, preprocessing, and augmenting your data to ensure it accurately represents the problem domain, as this can significantly reduce the need for extensive model tuning later on.
