When designing AI models, prioritize data quality over quantity. A well-curated dataset with diverse, representative samples will yield better performance than a large dataset filled with noise or bias. Regularly evaluate and clean your data to ensure it remains relevant and accurate, as this foundational step can significantly enhance the effectiveness of your AI solutions.
