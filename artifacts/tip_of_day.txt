When designing AI models, prioritize data quality over quantity. Clean, relevant, and well-annotated datasets will significantly improve your model's performance and reliability. Regularly evaluate and update your datasets to ensure they reflect the latest trends and variations in the target domain, as this can help prevent model drift and maintain accuracy over time.
