When building AI models, always prioritize data quality over quantity. High-quality, well-labeled datasets lead to better model performance and generalization. Invest time in data cleaning, augmentation, and validation processes to ensure your model learns from the most relevant and accurate information. This foundational step can significantly impact the success of your AI project.
