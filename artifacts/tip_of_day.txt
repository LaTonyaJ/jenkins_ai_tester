Focus on data quality over quantity: When building AI models, prioritize gathering high-quality, relevant data rather than just amassing large datasets. Clean, well-annotated, and representative data will lead to better model performance and generalization. Implement robust data preprocessing and validation steps to ensure your model learns from the best inputs possible.
